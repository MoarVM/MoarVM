Build instructions for Nintendo DS using devkitPro
and NMake under Windows.
==================================================

To build the library, you have to configure it first.
Since the NDS build uses devkitPro and NMake, assure
to have them in your %PATH%.

To configure the library, call one of the following,
depending if you want to use the processor in ARM or
THUMB mode:

  configure.bat /tool-gcc /target-nds-arm
  configure.bat /tool-gcc /target-nds-thumb

Note that the /tool-gcc flag is needed, because we're
using devkitARM (via devkitPro) which is based on the
GCC toolchain. The /target-nds-* flags don't imply
this.

Then, call:

  nmake /F Nmakefile
