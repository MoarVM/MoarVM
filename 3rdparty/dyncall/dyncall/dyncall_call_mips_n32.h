  two register-files for integer (promoted to 64-bit) and float (not promoted!)
  are used.

  arguments are transfered in a free slot on the corresponding register file.
  the other register-file will be skipped by one.

  float arguments are either loaded from single or double -
  a auto-conversion into double and then loaded as double precision
  turned out to fail for several tests.

  therefore a union for storage of float or double is used instead.
  a bitmask (mUseDouble) records which type is used and will be
  interpreted in the call-kernel.
