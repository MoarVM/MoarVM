build-system:
-------------
- cxx or cpp, overlay on OpenBSD/make  for cpp rule?
- add dependencies to Makefile.{generic|embedded}
- CPPFLAGS ?
- out-of-source building  
- cmake bites with buildsys/bsdmake and buildsys/gmake

  cmake generates Makefile files which have lower prio than {GNU|BSD}makefile's.
  
  buildsys/gmake fails if no top-level configure file is found with a
   message to cmake users.

  buildsys/bsdmake silently builds without configure file and
   no cmake-based build files is used at all.

  workaround:

    make -f Makefile

- cmake mac os x universal binary builds with *.S does not build 
  multiple architectures


portasm:
--------
- add solaris support for x64

dyncall:
--------
- support for 'long double'
- check if dcMode can be implemented in dcCallVM_XXX.c files directly..
- port x64: split callvm into a sysv and a win64, both available at run-time
- port ppc64
- support for return values: aggregate return values
- support for argument values: structures, half-precision, vector types, long double
- varargs for x64, mips

dynload:
--------
- bug: test/nm crashes on qemu mips linux o32 debian etch
- test/resolve_self crashes/asserts on windows and bsds
- rename SymsInit to InitSyms and similar for cleanup function to reflect naming
  in dyncall
- get rid of Dl_info and friends (_GNU_SOURCE) in dynload/dynload_syms_elf.c
  for implementation of dlSymsNameFromValue(..)

dyncallback:
------------
- callback_plain's return value not correct anymore on NDS (maybe just broken testcode?)
- add MIPS callbacks
- finish PPC32 callbacks
- add Plan9 support

urgent issues:
--------------
- add SPARC/SPARC64 calling conventions to doc's callconv-appendix !!!
- finish dyncallback doc, finish dynload doc, add both to troff doc
- Haiku/gmake build doesn't build dynload due to the fact, that elf.h is not found
  on default installations (one has to install the system headers)
  * add to doc
- Solaris/gmake build doesn't build dynload and tests anymore (maybe not even dyncallback)
- test arm32/ATPCS/THUMB (and then change Status in doc Appendix)
- look over code and fix TODO or @@@ marks
- consider moving bindings into dyncall/ such that releases include it in the future
  * or, alternatively, pack them separately and put them on the website, for releases
- add note to documentation, that bindings are svn-only ATM
- add pcc-support to doc
- check why the iyonix, etc. platforms have been taken out of 'configure'
- rename configure to configure.sh (so we would have .sh, .rc and .bat in the future)
- not sure, but configure(.sh) --tool-xxx might overwrite --asm-xxx, in some cases

nice to have:
-------------
- enhance manual with a couple of examples (e.g. calling MessageBoxA on windows, etc.)
- update: microsoft visual c++ build files - integrate all test suites in solution file
- rename iPhoneOS to iOS (mostly done)
- maybe rename DC__Arch_PowerPC to ...PPC32 for coherency reasons (...PPC64)?
- consistency: on x64 platforms: make both ABIs available ('win64','sysv') for all x64 OS ports
- microsoft build enhancement: autodetect assembly via C preprocessor (like with .S gcc files)
- enhancement: state-machine error reporting (stack overflow and invalid mode)? (e.g. dcError() )
- test/thunk: some platforms do not allow for allocation of executable code on heap and stack -- 
  currently this test will crash, maybe we should collect information which platforms allow and which not.

bugs:
-----
- vararg function calls don't work for PPC32 System V ABI
- callbacks don't work for PPC32 System V ABI
- vararg function calls don't work for ARM THUMB mode (Daniel's new interface for modesetting for varag
  args should be used); adapt test/ellipsis
