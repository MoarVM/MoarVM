## 3rd party libraries

These are imported forks of external library projects.  Their source
redistribution licenses are for the most part as permissive or more permissive
than MoarVM's itself.  We have imported them here because we needed to make
extensive modifications to their capabilities or exposed API, and so couldn't
use system packages, or available system packages are too far out of date.
