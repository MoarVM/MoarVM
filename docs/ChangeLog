  (Primary Unicode Data source file)
  + Note, we have the correct values for most of these other codepoints, but
    the goal is the get even these currently reserved characters working. Main
    pluses for this are: 1. Correctness 2. Unicode sometimes sets properties for
    codepoints based on likely future usage. This would allow better correctness
    if an older version of MoarVM is used with codepoints from a future versions
    of Unicode codepoints (as could be the case with OS distributions lagging
