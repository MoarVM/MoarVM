=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

moar respects the following environment variables:

=over

=item MVM_JIT_DISABLE

Disables the just-in-time compiler (JIT). This is ignored if MoarVM was built
without JIT support.

=item MVM_SPESH_DISABLE

Disables the runtime bytecode specializer / optimizer.

=item MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE

Disables inlining of call frames inside the bytecode specializer.

=item MVM_SPESH_OSR_DISABLE

Disables the on-stack replacement feature of the bytecode specializer.

=item MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG

Tells MoarVM to insert instrumentation to detect when a thread does a write
to an object it didn't allocate and doesn't have a lock for.

=item MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG_INCLUDE_LOCKED

Same as MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG, except objects that are locked are included
as well.
