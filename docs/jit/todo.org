#+TITLE: JIT Compiler TODO list

* VM integration
** DONE Stack walker for current position

 Currently we mark the 'current position' in the JIT entry label at the
 start of every basic block, the start-and-end of frame handlers, and
 the start-and-end of inlines. This is major code bloat, for a feature
 that is only necessary in exceptional cases,

 Concept of stack walker is very simple:
 #+BEGIN_SRC asm
        mov rcx, 1 ; rsp = []
        call foo  ; rsp = [label:],
 label: mov rcx, rax;  rsp = []
        ...

 foo: ; stack (from rsp) looks like: [label:]
      push rbp     ; [label:,rbp]
      mov rbp, rsp ; rbp is now top of stack, so that
      add rsp, 0xff; rsp = [label:,rbp, ? x 1]
      ...
      sub rsp, 0xff ; rsp = [label:,rbp]
      pop rbp       ; rsp = [label:]
      ret           ; rsp = []
 #+END_SRC

 - On POSIX, arg 0 = rdi, arg 1 = rsi, arg2 = rdx.
 - On Windows, arg0 = rcx, arg1 = rdx, arg2 = r8.
 - On linux, names are generally used as-is, mac wants them prefixed by an underscore.

 Desirable thing: limit the depth of stack walking to some reasonable number (say, 5 or so)

 #+BEGIN_SRC asm
 walk_stack_posix:
 _walk_stack_posix:
     mov rcx, rdi ; base pointer
     mov r8,  rdx ; maximum number of steps
     mov rdx, rsi ; end pointer
 _walk_stack_win64:
     # rdi = base pointer, rsi = end pointer
     push rbp
     mov r9, rsp
 loop:
     dec r8 ; counter
     jz done
     mov rax, qword ptr [r9+0x8]
     mov r9, qword ptr [r9]
     cmp rax, rcx
     jl  loop
     cmp rax, rdx
     jg  loop
 done:
     ## rax is now within range by definition, or, we're to deep
     pop rbp
     ret
 #+END_SRC

 There are three things to do:

 This doesn't have to start in the expr JIT though.

 - Figure out where we need it. As far as I can tell, this is separate
   from the jit_entry_label thing, and we will never *set* the
   jit_entry_label with the result of this value, as that might lead to
   a jump right behind the handler, and in the case of a THROWISH_POST,
   an infinite loop. Indeed throwish_pre and throwish_post don't change.
   - src/exceptions.c: search_frame_handlers (we compare the current
     jit label, but we're interested in the current position); other
     than that, the only updates are to the goto_handlers, and/or
     setting the resume labels, but that only ever happens with
     throwobj, and that one is explicitly throwish anyway, so the
     jit_entry_label will be set correctly.
   - src/core/frame.c: assignments from predefined labels, but, also,
     MVM_frame_find_contextual_by_name, which uses it as a location
     marker. For frames higher in the callstack, that is correct,
     though, so we need to distinguish the top frame from the rest.
   - src/spesh/deopt.c: for upper frames, we use jit_entry_label as
     current location marker.... which is correct as it relies on exact
     matches, and anything invoking anything that could deopt_all must
     set the label anyway.
 - Finally, configure our toolchain so they have
   =-fno-omit-frame-pointer= portably, this is spelled =[[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2kxx5t2c.aspx][/Oy]]= in microsoft
   land.
 - Integrate this in the build system. clang and gcc can build this
   just fine (clang is ... whiney about comment syntax).  Microsoft
   has: [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/assembler/masm/masm-for-x64-ml64-exe][ml64]]. It also supports intel syntax. It can be a bit fuzzy
   about directives. I don't want to ask our users to install another
   assembler, but what I can do is use the C preprocessor to smoothen
   out the differences (with $(CC) -E or whatever is the equivalent for
   windows).

*** DONE stack walker itself
*** DONE hide jit_entry_label from core

*** DONE activate stack walker
*** DONE remove eager dynamic label storage
*** DONE build system integration

This works without issues on linux/gcc, but I'll have to see about
MSVC and apple/clang I think I need to define a rule for '.s' just
like there is for .c.

*** DONE replace with return address pointer pointer

Even with =/Oy-= (and =-fno-omit-frame-pointer=) we can't reliably
walk the stack on windows, because we can store other things than
=rbp= under the =rsp= - so the 'linked list' is simply not respectd.

What we *can* do instead, is take a pointer to where we know the
return address will be (which is =rsp-0x8=, because that is fully
under our control. This works (but uncovers an existing bug (somehow)
in the expr JIT).

*** DONE the windows bug

- This appears to be a broken label issue (backwards halfway into an
  instruction)
- I need to know where that label is supposed to point too though, and
  how far it is supposed to go

** DONE Replace 'invokish' and 'throwish' check code with return address updates

Currently, we have to check arround every 'invokish' opcode whether or
not we have in fact invoked (by comparing the current frame sequence
number with the stored frame sequence number). If we have, we need to
jump out to the interpreter.

For throwish opcodes, we go a bit further; becuase we may require a
jump within the frame (to go to the correct frame handler), we load
the jit-entry-label after the opcode, then jump towards that after the
throwish opocde (if we haven't already jumped out due to different
frame nrs). If we haven't in fact thrown, this is effectively a no-op.

We can completely avoid doing either of those things if we update the
return address instead.

- invokish/throwish opcodes that need to trampoline to the interpreter
  can do so by setting the return label to the =-exit= pointer
  instead, see [[https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/reference.html#dasm_setupglobal][dasm_setupglobal]] on how to get this label
- throwish opcodes that need to do an 'internal' jump can also update
  this pointer, and execution will automatically continue there.

Have to investigate if there are more options than that, but I don't
really think so. This makes invokish ops nearly free if not actually
invoking.

We can *not* update an invokee's frame that way, because the relevant
=rbx= register will point to the wrong frame. (Unfortunately!)

- [x] get exit label.

  we unfortunately can't get the exact constant name because it is
  only defined in the 'dasc' file
- [x] assign a new label
- [x] frame.c
  - frame entry
  - frame exit
  - unwind
- [x] deopt.c
  - frame exit (never the current frame though, always the caller, so
    no work there)
- [x] exceptions.c
  - frame exit
  - within-frame jump (GOTO)
- [x] emit.dasc
  - control handlers
  - invocations
- [x] continuation.c
  - =MVM_continuation_control= tries to find a frame with a matching tag,
    then invokes *another* frame with that continuation.
  - It does not currently store the current JIT position (for the
    purpose of reentry), so that might explain infinite-looping.
  - Also, the invoke of code will try to set the jit return address to
    a label, reading from a frame not associated with the JIT code
    (potentially not *having* any JIT code, hence crashing).
    - What this needs is both jit-leave-frame, and
      jit-store-current-position.
  - =MVM_continuation_reset= either calls =MVM_continuation_invoke=
    (on a continuation) or =fSTABLE(code)->invoke= (on any other code
    object) - if that is interpreter code, it should normally pass
    through =MVM_frame_invoke=, and so we have that handled.
  - =MVM_continuation_invoke= also calls =STABLE(code)->invoke=, so
    same goes there
- [x] nativecall.c
  - somehow tell the JIT not to emit code assigning a jit_return_address?
  - a flag on the graph probably
- [x] nativecall_dyncall / nativecall_libffi
  - when handling a callback, these are the only conceivable options
    of running a recursive interpreter frame; and we store a jmp_buf

Should we set a tc->jit_exit_label to the jitcodes' exit label always?
would simplify things a bit.

*** DONE wrap in tidy interface and check assigment

We want some form of abstraction, if only for 'set current position',
so that we can check we're setting a value within bounds.

I'm not sure if there are more such abstractions to be had... But this
will help me debug for sure.

Let's add:
- [x] MVM_jit_code_set_current_position()
- [x] MVM_jit_code_trampoline()

Turns out, if we have an exception and we set a return-after handler...

Then we can't bloody well jump to the lower frame. It won't work.

*** DONE clean up

- [x] graph.h
- [x] graph.c
- [x] emit.dasc
- [x] epxr.c


* Tools
** Create =make-gdb-script.pl= script

It should be relatively easy to create a script to startup GDB (or
another debugger) with the correct context. I've been writing a few of
those by hand now.

** Make =jit-bisect.pl= figure out if something is expr-bisectable

Currently we rely on a flag. But the jit-bisect.pl tool *can* figure
out which combination of flags break or unbreak a run. So why not for
the expr JIT as well?

** Make =jit-dump.pl= work on windows

 This should be doable, really, if rather than pipe-and-fork, we simply
 use a temporary file and use that as an intermediate.

First problem is to make it capture the output in the first
place. (Backticks work, it seems, so we can always try that).

** Make =jit-comparify-asm.pl= warn about broken labels

Currently, we try to resovle the link address directly. What we should
probably do is compute a table of linked addresses and code addresses,
and then warn about anything that's not a link address.

** Make =expr-template-compiler.pl warn for conditional-use-before-unconditional-use

This is a common cause of errors, because the conditional use will
'define' the value, and the tiler will not emit code to redefine it
for the unconditional use. Especially dangerous is that this can
happen in macro expansions (like write-barrier).

This should probably be a hard error. How to go about checking it?

First:
- we can only get this problem in DAGs not trees
- we can only create a DAG with named references (=$1=, =$foo=)
- we can only have a conditional use if we have one of the following node types:
  - WHEN (second node is conditional)
  - IF/IFV (second and third nodes are conditional)
  - ALL/ANY (all but first, and the 'conditionality' is relative)

I'm thinking of using a stack to indicate the conditional order of
definitions and uses.... but I'm not sure how just yet.


* Expression Tree

** Reduce tree node size to 32 bits

 Tree nodes are currently 64 bits wide to allow them to coexist with
 constant pointers. This is handy, but not really required, since we
 could use a lookup table to get the pointers (as long as we can
 declare pointers, for which I think we can still use the '@' sigil,
 e.g:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (template: say
    (call (const @MVM_string_say ptr_sz)
          (arglist 2
            (carg (tc) ptr)
            (carg $0 ptr))
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 The @MVM_string_say pointer can be stashed in an array:

 #+BEGIN_SRC C
 static const void *MVM_jit_expr_ptrs[] = {
    ...
    MVM_string_say,
    ...
 };
 #+END_SRC

 And the pointer itself replaced by the index.

 We could argue against dealing with 64 bit constants in general, but
 unfortunately, const_i64 prevents us from doing that.... Ways of
 dealing with that:

 + A 'large constants' table per tree (into which we could copy both the
   i64 constants and the function pointer constants)
   + We could store this entire table in the data section, too
 + A 'large constants' op, which could take the space to store the 64
   bit constant directly; one of the advantages of that is that we
   could specialise tiling to that (e.g. there is no advantage to
   including a very large constant in the ADD tile since the underlying
   'add' instruction cannot handle it).
 + Or both: have a large_const op and a large_const table, and only
   have the large_const op refer to the large_const table (i.e. not the
   regular const)

NB - I didn't do the @ notation, because it turns out we need to
specially handle the indirected constants, and because of platform
differences, we also make the distinction between large constants in
general (MVMint64 or MVMnum64) and pointer constants, because pointers
have different sizes per architecture, and general large constants do
not.


** Encode (parts of) info as flags

Even when we'd have 32 bit operands and we'd (wastefully) use 16 bits
for the operator (rather than 8 which would be till 4x more than we
use now), we still have 16 perfectly good bits left. What I want to do
is to make info mostly sparse, so that:

- we can use a hashtable to represent all nodes that do have info
- we can encode all relevant attributes 'inline'

Which would be:
- number-of-args (redundant but nice, especially if it gets rid of the
  first-child-node-is-arg-count nonsense)
  - we could maximize this to 16? (4 bits) or 32 (5 bits)
- size (1,2,4,8) (2 bits or 3 bits)
  - that may be a bit aggressive, we may want to support SIMD?
- type flag (int/num/str/obj) (2 bits or 5 bits if we want to encode
  the whole field)

All that would remain of info would be spesh_ins, meaning that this
would become sufficiently sparse to use a hash table, which would mean
we no longer need to resize the number of args.


** REPR-Specialized expression code

 Parts needed:
 + A hook for instructions with operands of known repr type to insert a template
   + So how do we know which instruction/operand this is? (Hardcode with a switch, maybe)
   + Runtime hook should be similar to spesh hook
   + We should probably pass the tree and let the repr do manipulations itself for maximum flexibility
   + and have a default hook which attempts to apply a template
   + return root if succesful, otherwise -1 (in which case we can fallback to the normal mode)
   + should have a separate jit flags entry which is also settable by
     the specializer (for jittivity, template destructiveness, possibly
     other things)
   + operands loading must be public / template apply must become 'public methods'
 + Compile-time support for arbitrary templates in the expression templates
   + I think adding to a makefile list is acceptable, in general, but
     it would be nice if we could have a substitution rule that would
     make sure the expression templates are compiled 'automatically'

** FLAGVAL ALL/ANY

 Basically, flagval all/any is legal according to the type system, it
 will just never work. We should translate it to (IF (ALL|ANY ..)
 (CONST 1 1) (CONST 0 1))

 The problem is, replacing all references to the node. (This is common
 with the optimizer, which also needs it).

 We don't actually need this yet, but we don't guard against it
 either. (So maybe install an oops in analyze first).

NB - I didn't do the @ notation, because it turns out we need to
specially handle the indirected constants, and because of platform

** Use explicit stack for tree walking

Simple, mechanical transformation. I wonder if we can have a maximum
depth; probably not, if we can allow revisits. More importantly, this
should allow for some control on the iteration order

** Right-to-left evaluation

 E.g. (STORE addr value sz) - it usually makes sense to calculate value
 before address. There are a bunch of these things, and then again, a
 bunch of things that rely on left-to-right evaluation:

 + IF/IFV
 + ALL/ANY
 + DO/DOV

 So the thing is probably to:
 + store a preference per op
 + add a policy for the traverser (default,left-to-right,right-to-left)


* Register Allocator
** Switch to storing register numbers in a stack rather than in a ring

Using a ring has the disadvantage that register values are
'continuously moving', even when they do not need to be.

** Dump register allocator graph

I think it should be possible to dump the (result) of register
allocation. That is to say, create a graph that displays all tiles,
their basic block structure, the live range structure, and their
spills.

** Support multiple register classes

I want to distinguish register classes using ranges, i.e. on x86-64,
0-15 are GPR, 16-31 would be FPR. The trick is mostly:

*** Find out if register selection for FPRs is supported
*** Support register buffers per class

** Generalized 3-operand to 2-operand conversion

Already implemented for direct-memory binary ops, but needs to be
extended to take into account indirect-access ops and memory base +
indexed ops.

More to the point, I'd like this to be a restriction we can build into
the allocator itself, so it doesn't need last-minute patchup.

*** Use register stack rather than ring buffer

Ring buffers register allocation 'cycle' through registers and thereby
cause more moves than a stack would.

** Reduce spills
*** Maintain memory backed positions

Currently, when we need to spill a value, we always treat it as if it
were a temporary, i.e. we store it to a *new* location in the local
memory buffer. We increment the local memory buffer, too.  This is
suboptimal for values that are not temporaries, i.e. values that are
stored to the local value buffer anyway.

+ stored to a local value
+ directly retrieved from a local value

There are two classes of such values:
There is no need to ever spill such values to memory.

 #+BEGIN_SRC c
 /* Return -1 if not a local store, 0 <= i <= frame->work_size if it is */
 MVMint32 is_local_store(MVMJitExprTree *tree, MVMint32 node) {

     return ins->op_info->operands[0].reg.orig;

*** Don't spill-and-load directly between definition and use

Or rather, if we can prove that there can be no 'spills' inbetween a
definition and use (and they are in the same basic block), let's
'merge' the atomic live ranges.

*** Don't spill constants

 - We can either do that as part of the optimizer, or as part of the
   allocator, or both.
 - It is *simpler* to do it for the allocator (if a value we're
   spilling has a single definition, and that definition is a constant,
   copy it)
 - It might be more effective to do it in the expression optimizer
** Generalized register requirements
Bunch of options possible:
- it's a requirement for an output register
  - the register is allocatable
    - which is /free/, in which case we can just take it (how I do I
      know it's free? by a register map, which we need to make)
    - which is /not free/, in which case we need to /spill/ the
      current register
  - the register is not allocatable (e.g. %rax)
    - I'm going to go ahead and assume that it is free nevertheless,
      otherwise we'd have to record the set of non-allocatable
      registers clobbered
    - However, if the value is to live, it's probably best to copy it
      to an allocatable register
- it is a requirement for an input register
  - that is not yet a problem I have (because I made %rax the spare
    register), but most of the considerations of clobbering described
    below apply
  - it is an existing problem for ARGLIST compilation, but there it is
    handled seprately (although it is fairly similar, and might generalize!)
- it clobbers a register (not necessarily one it uses), e.g. div which
  clobbers %rdx to store the modulo (and %rax for the quotient).
  - if free, no problem whatever
  - if non-free, we again need to start moving registers, but I'm not
    sure this requires the full shuffling requirements of ARGLIST.

*** Precoloring

 I'd like to try and figure out if we can add 'prefered registers' to
 tiles based on definition or use in tile requirements.

** Try to use 'holes' for allocation.

Not 100% sure this is worth the additional complexity since it means
that a register can have multiple occupants, which means you'll want
to use a linked list, and a heap for maintaining the first-to-expire
set, or a double-ended priority queue, etc.

Simplest thing to do is try and prove that the live range will be
'embedded' within the hole in all cases. But this is tricky when there
might be a spill inbetween.

** Support loops in lifetime hole finding

Note that Wimmer's paper describes computing holes and live range
extents are implemented in a single step, so we might implement that
as well.

* Optimizer

Not implemented at all, so we need some new things.


** DONE An equivalence function

We have one (MVM_jit_expr_tree_eqv), but it's problem is that it tries
to iterate to the leaves, whereas it should iterate to a certain depth
(but how to specify the depth in different branches?)

** DONE A replacement 'function'

Basically we require the possibility to update all uses of a node with
another one, including roots, if necessary.

Now, there will never be more uses than nodes, so we can build a
'usage' table-of-linked-list from a single block of memory.

Walks should be single-visit.


** TODO Example optimizations

*** TODO common subexpression elimination
  - idea: (hash) table of expr, node
  - table is created bottom-up
    - all children are replaced with equivalent (according to the table)

    benefit from inserting a COPY, so they don't use indirect
    operations, e.g.
  - Basic idea: count number of users of 'load', if > 1, insert the
    COPY node and replace the refs
  - Possibly a pessimization because it requires more registers!

*** DONE COPY elimination
  - possibly the first step, removing redundant copies
  - especially for CONST nodes

*** TODO CONST copying
  - A const never needs to be kept in memory, and it is just as well
    to keep just a single reference to it. (This might be better in
    the register allocator though)
