#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Register allocator

Currently, multiple live ranges can inhabit the same location (due to
copies, IF resolution, etc). This is problematic, and results from the
fact that we only allow a single definition per live range. This
significantly complicates handling stores and loads.

The better approach is to allow multiple definitions per live range,
which makes it stand for the entire life of a single variable. These
definitions can be found by using the disjoint-set algorithm,
combining values via PHI (or in our case, COPY/DO/IF nodes). This
makes sense as (preferably) all these values use the same register.



** DONE Implement IF/EITHER handling

I am seeing an issue with the node of synthetic tiles. The register
allocator observes this node to see what kind of step it has to take
on e.g. IF nodes.  But we copy these node values into their synthetic
tiles, which has no real value so far as I can see....

Copying the node into the tile will cause issues currently because
we cannot distinguish between the postorder 'resolution' `IF` tile and
the synthetic inorder `IF` tiles, except that the latter has a pointer to
a template and the former does not.



** DONE Remove cruft from previous attempts

- we don't need MVMJitValue anymore (yay, no more value types)
  - instead we can assign register addresses directly to tiles (8 bits
    is sufficient)
- we don't need double-linked lists either, because live ranges now
  contain their own set

*** DONE Get rid of template pointers in the tile object

This is a far-too-brittle construction that artificially distinguishes
between 'real' tiles and pseudotiles, and there is no reason to have them,
except that (in some places) we rely on the difference. An unintended
consequence is that it is complex to add pseudotiles that refer to
live ranges (like loads and spills) with reference to the live ranges
they affect, because (currently) these live ranges are refered to by
tree node extraction, and pseudotiles don't do that. It is,
altogether, brittle.

The suggested solution is to move tree extraction to an earlier tiling
step (postorder, so the tree can't change underneath from tile
conflict resolution) and to use the existing args buffer for this
purpose. We can then separate live ranges from args using compaction.

A further requirement is a correct way to distinguish between
postorder and inorder tiles. We can do that by removing information
(pointing to a synthetic node, or using a sentinel value) but it might
be preferable to add information (signifiying the position in the tree
the tile represents).

So the rephrase, currently the template is used by the register allocator to signify:
- value result type
- extract refered-to nodes
  - in ARGLIST/DO/IF cases, this is directly read from the tree
    but these are exceptions


Whereas the node is used to signify:
- special data (the TC/CU/STACK/FRAME/VMNULL family)
- data flow (DO/IF)
- clobbering of registers (CALL)

**** DONE Represent register requirements intelligently

 We currently rely on inspecting the template to see if the thing
 yields a value. However, yielding a value is specific to a tile not
 its template.

 This is also related to the issue of specifying register preferences.
 We want to specify that a certain tile takes certain input registers
 and yields an output register. And I think we can do this with a
 bitmap, so let's design that.

 Suppose we allow 4 register inputs (currently 8, but this is only
 relevant for ARGLIST, which can be dealt with specifically in some
 other context).

 And suppose we allow for 32 different register locations to be
 specified (5 bits per register).  That gives us 4 bits + 20 bits = 24
 bits....  We can be 'richer' and allow 6 bits per register * 4 + 4
 bits is still just 28 bits. If we allow 8 registers - no reason to,
 but let's suppose so, then 48 + 8 = 54 bits necessary, i.e., fits in a
 single 64 bit quadword. But I think 32 bits are quite sufficient.

 Note that the 6 bits is sufficient to specify register class (on
 x86-64) as well as register specification. This gives us a total of 8
 bits, or one byte, per register. We can then scale linearly up to the
 number of bits required.

 #+BEGIN_SRC c
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_ENCODE(req,nr) (1 | ((req) << 1) | ((nr) << 2))
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_SPEC(a,b,c,d) ((a &0xff) | ((b &0xff) << 8) | ((c & 0xff) << 16) | ((d & 0xff) << 24))
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_FETCH(spec,n) ((spec >> (8*n))&0xff)
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_NONE 0
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISER_ANY   1
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_IS_USED(desc) (desc & 1)
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_HAS_REQUIREMENT(desc) ((desc & 2) >> 1)
 #define MVM_JIT_REGISTER_REQUIREMENT(desc) ((desc & 0xfc) >> 2)

 /* we could also do */
 ostruct registerspec {
     int used : 1;
     int has_requirement : 1;
     int required_register : 6;
 };
 /* but this is 4 bytes wide */
 #+END_SRC

 So the second question is how are we going to encode this in the tile
 texts? My initial guess was to add an extra list; but we already
 specify which things are registers in the tile itself, and we can just
 add it as an attribute.

 So we can get (for instance):

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (tile: div (div reg:rax reg:rcx) reg:rax)
 (tile: mod (mod reg:rax reg:rcx) reg:rcx)
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Fortunately, we have two-operand mul these days, so it needs no
 specific treatment, although full-precision (i.e. two-registers
 rax:rdx pair) can't be done.

**** DONE Use the register spec for finding values

This needs to be implemented in both the old (register.c) allocator
and the new (linear_scan.c) allocator.

**** DONE Move tree path resolution to tiling

Needs adding a refs buffer to the tile. I think that synthetic tile
construction still doesn't need it (yet), because we now reference
from live range to tile, not the other way arround.
An optimizer may change that, though.

**** DONE Remove MVMJitValue as a global type

The 'old' register allocator will still need it so we'll rename it to
ValueList and make it local; tile->values will be MVMint8[4], which is
quite sufficient for all possible registers except for arglist, but
that needs special-casing anyway.

**** DONE Legitimise 'defintiion' tiles

Nodes such as TC, CU, etc. operate by defining the register which
holds the value. So I'd like to define them as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(define: (tc) reg:r14)
(define: (cu) reg:r13)
(define: (stack) reg:rsp)
(define: (local) reg:rbx)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So to get that done, I need to extend the sexpr parser a bit, and find
a decent way to combine the symbols. That can be done relatively
easily:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
/* src/gen/config.h */
#define MVM_JIT_ARCH MVM_JIT_X64
/* src/jit/internal.h */
#define MVM_JIT_REG_MK2(a,n) a ## _ ## n
#define MVM_JIT_REG_MK1(a,n) MVM_JIT_REG_MK2(a,n)
#define MVM_JIT_REG(n) MVM_JIT_REG_MK1(MVM_JIT_ARCH,n)

enum {
X64_GPR(MVM_JIT_REG)
};

/* src/jit/register.h */
#define MVM_JIT_REQUIRE(n) (3 | ((MVM_JIT_REG(n)) << 2))
int i = MVM_JIT_REQUIRE(RSP);
#+END_SRC

**** DONE Use register requirements on definition tiles

- reading of register requirements from tile
- look up table to detect that certain registers are non-volatile (callee-saved)
- in single-pass allocator, predefine non-volatile register value references

*** DONE tile editor code moves to tile.c
   - keep it abstract?
   - internalize into list? (why not?)

** DONE Work on operation nodes

Specifically:
- FRAME/VMNULL are not atomic ops, but instead specific load
  sequences, and it'd be preferable for reasons of efficiency
  to treat them that way
- I'd like to have a DIE node which is equivalent to a CALL node, but
  which does not return (relevant for the purposes of register
  allocation)
- Similarily, signed and unsigned cast have, in the case of 4-to-8
  byte conversions, different register requirements, and should be
  separated for that reason alone
  - It may actually make some sense to have an architecture-specific
    'specialization' phase operating on the tree...



** DONE Find live ranges

I think we can do this in a single pass, or maybe two passes

- to implmeent disjoint-set we build a union-find array
  - each thing is initially in it's own set
  - the key of the set is the number of the node it refers to
  - at phis/copies, we pick the set with the lowest key / largest
    definition set (whichever we know easier)
- definitions and uses are tile-list indexes
- we still need a tile-to-live-range map
  - we can just run get_nodes() again and again...
  - nope, we really can't; we need to insert and maintain 'synthetic' live nodes
- we use a second pass to find all definitions and uses (maybe keep
  counts of these)
  - if we do it in the first pass, the uses/definitions are going to
    refer to possibly-merged sets, so we have to resolve those during
    the later passes; it's easier to do so earlier,
  - if we count the number of uses and definitions in the first pass
    we can simply store them in a single buffer in the second pass
- to split a live range (at a given point), we must
  - split both uses and definitions
  - if these placed in ascending order in a single buffer, we can
    split that buffer without copying (in most cases)
  - the exception is if a single conditional branch of a definition is
    split off, since it may be 'inbetween' the buffer, but we can fix
    that by shuffling (in principle)
  - point all the uses in the split live range to the new live range

** DONE Implement linear scan

The basic idea of linear scan is:
- iterate over live ranges in order of first definition
  - if any of the current live range is dead, remove it from the
    current live set (so that their register becomes free for the new
    live set)
  - assign them to current live set
  - if the live range has a prefered register
    - if this prefered register is taken
      - then we have a conflict (resolve by spilling/splitting)
      - else assign the prefered register to that live range

NB; Even though we have created the list of live ranges in sorted
order, we'll want to use it as a binary heap, because we can cheaply
maintain the heap property - it is already initialized that way -
while inserting new live ranges (for loading spilled values).

- assign registers in a second pass
  - reuse the register assignment ring buffer
  - we've already dealt with prefered-register conflicts in the
    earlier step, so we can always assign the prefered register
  - if the prefered register is already taken, then we can take
    another register and swap it with its' current holder, which is
    guaranteed to be possible.

The current live set can be implemented as a heap of integers pointing
to the live range array. This may be preferable to the current
insertion-sorted array because spilling is rare and this pessimizes
the expire-register case.....

Maybe we should have the prefered-register thing per use/defintiion,
but that becomes very complicated fast.



*** DONE Use linked list for use/definition storage

The number of definition/use references is strictly limited to
4*num_tiles, because each tile can only define one value and use at
most 3 values, except for ARGLIST tiles, but they need special
handling (which isn't really a problem; we can count these
separately, if necessary during tiling). This means we can allocate
all nodes in a single step (even without spesh allocation).

Further, it is no longer really necessary to distinguish between uses
and definitions explicitly, since I can do it implicitly by the
0-value-is-definition convention.

I don't think I can roll in the synthetic tiles in the linked list
structure since I still need an explicit number to identify their
position.

So we then have:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
typedef struct {
    MVMint32 key;
    MVMint32 idx;
} UnionFind;

typedef struct ValueRef ValueRef;
struct ValueRef {
    MVMint32 tile_idx;
    MVMint32 value_idx;
    ValueRef *next;
};

typedef struct {
    ValueRef *first, *last;

    MVMint32     synth_pos[2];
    MVMJitTile* synth_tile[2];

    /* sufficient for now */
    MVMint8 register_spec;
    MVMint8 register_num;
} LiveRange;

static inline MVMint32 first_ref(LiveRange *r) {
    MVMint32 a = r->synth_tile[0] != NULL ? r->synth_pos[0]    : INT32_MAX;
    MVMint32 b = r->first         != NULL ? r->first->tile_idx : INT32_MAX;
    return MIN(a,b);
}

static inline MVMint32 last_ref(LiveRange *r) {
    MVMint32 a = r->synth_tile[1] != NULL ? r->synth_pos[1]    : INT32_MAX;
    MVMint32 b = r->last          != NULL ? r->last->tile_idx : INT32_MAX;
}
#+END_SRC

*** DONE register assignment

Register assignment should be inline with the register allocation
step, because otherwise we simply have to iterate twice in the same
order over the same dataset. While possible, it is redundant.

Register assignment also updates the uses and definitions of tiles
using the value reference.

*** DONE Make non-volatile-register bitmap a constant

The trick is to replace the literal comma ',' with a COMMA macro in
src/jit/x64/arch.h, and then to define COMMA as '|' locally. We can
then declare a bitmap as:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#define SHIFT(x) (1 << (x))
#undef COMMA
#define COMMA |
static const MVMint64 NVR_BITMAP = MVM_JIT_ARCH_NONVOLATILE_GPR(SHIFT);
#undef COMMA
#define COMMA ,
#+END_SRC

I know, right. Subject for a blog post at the very least.

*** DONE Implement spilling

Spilling is implemented by inserting stores (if not present) after
every definition and loads before every use. Many operations actually
have stores appended (I haven't optimized them away, yet), so it may
never be necessary to insert the spill code. But we still need to
insert loads.

A byproduct of this method is that we must leave a number of registers
free to load spilled values; three is sufficient for x86-64. (OR we
generate new live ranges for the just-loaded values, which
automatically does the right thing as well.)

*** TODO Generalize IF nodes to PHI tilezs

We append a 'definition' IF tile, but this notion of merging live
ranges could generalize to a PHI tile, which could also be used to
support looping constructs. So all this requires is

a): the introduction of a PHI op
b): replacing the IF node type with a PHI node type

*** DONE Implement three-operand to two-operand conversion

Safely translating this form (expr JIT):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
r0 = r1 <op> r2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Into (x86):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
r0 = r0 <op> r1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Requires, in general, at least one additional register, since if

- r0 == r1, then r1 := r2, and this is equivalent so no further work is necessary
- r0 == r2,
  - and A <op> B == B <op> A, (<op> is /commutative/) then this is
    also equivalent, and no further work (or aliasing) is necessary
    - this is true for ADD, OR, AND, MUL, not true for SUB, XOR, DIV
  - or A <op> B != B <op> A, then we first need to copy r1 to a temporary register,
    assign r0 := rtmp, r1 := r2, and copy rtmp -> r0
- r0 != r1 && r0 != r2, then copy r0 <- r1, r1 := r2, and we're done

I suggest that rax becomes this temporary register, as there are
already a bunch of opcodes that depend on it otherwise, and this saves
having to spill when we enocunter one of them.

There may be an alternative way to do this, but it relies either on an
extra loop (and mapping tiles back to live ranges somehow, or using a
rename table) or a loop 'within' linear scan.

Actually, that last bit is not a bad idea per se; since we know that
we process live ranges in order of first definition, we also know that
all tiles prior to our current live range must be well-defined (have
complete registers).

*** TODO Implement three-op conversion for indirect instructions

- We should either mark tiles as indirect, or pass it as a flag
- Indirect ops can have up to two 'secondary' register arguments
  - and these shouldn't be overwritten either!


*** TODO Implement live-range splitting

One might split a live range in two, for example, if a set of uses
preceeds the point where the range would need to be spilled; the value
may reside in the register before the spill and reside in storage
afterwards.

So in fact, splitting implies:
- taking all definitions/uses within some range
- creating a new live range for range splitted of, inserting it in the
  live range heap (hence a heap!)
- and spill the necessary registers.

(When do we actually need this?)

*** TODO Precoloring

Comes down to:
- maintaining a table of last-register-used to register-preferences
- assigning a prefered register to certain live ranges
  - if a conflict is present for a single live range, split it (and
    insert a copy between)
  - if a conflict is present between multiple live ranges, spill (one
    of) them

- an output register is fundamentally different from an input register:
  - output single-live-range conflict (multiple definitions different prefered output):
    - pick one, split off the other, insert a copy between them
  - input single-live-range conflict (different prefered register for output/input)
    - split off output range from input range; copy to output range
      (if not spilled)

  - multiple live-range register conflict

    - first-defined output register /must/ be spilled in order to make room for second registe

      - exception: lifetime holes

    - output-input conflict

      - output-register must be copied off /or/ spilled

** DONE Implement ARGLIST handling

ARGLIST prepares arguments to function calls. This means placing
values in their correct places, which may mean inserting COPYs, loads
and spills.

- Live ranges pointing to NVR (static) objects can be converted by
  introducing a copy between them (generating a new live range)
- We typically expire old live ranges prior to the start of new ones,
  but for ARGLIST this is not a good idea, since it expires values
  which may be last used in ARGLIST, and thus 'forgets' that these
  values are there.
- It is unfortunately not possible to 'afterswap' the registers, as it
  may introduce a conflict (e.g. C lives in rax, A in rcx, B in rax
  after C has expired; B would need to be in rcx, but swapping A and B
  will introduce a conflict between C and B).
- We could (attempt) to 'precolor' the register graph, but it is kind
  of subtle, and the more I think about it, the more I believe it
  might require an additional loop.

Another design issue is how to implement it in cross-platform way,
since it ties deeply into the register allocator.....

Maybe just drive it to data. Take an arglist, return an array of {
storage_class, storage_pos }, and use some kind of sorting, swapping,
spilling to assign the right values to the right locations. Let the
stack be a storage class.

*** DONE Pre-count ARGLIST references

Needed to allocate the correct amount of reference objects to account
for the live range objects. Can be done simply during tiling.

*** DONE Factor load-and-store insertion out of spilling

Wanted to generalize spilling to support spilling-over-callsites.
So currently we do:

+ Select a register + live range
+ Select a storage location
+ Iterate over all value refs in the live range and
  + If a definition, insert a synthetic tile just after to store that value (insert_pos = ref->tile_idx, insert_order = -1)
  + If a use, insert a synthetic tile just before to load that value (insert_pos = ref->tile_idx - 1, insert_order = +1)
  + Create a new 'atomic' live range and
    + Assign our newly created synthetic tile to it
    + Assign our current value ref to it, as well, and take it from the current live range (to be processed)
    + If prior to current position, assign given register (to live range + tile) and mark as expired
    + If later than current position, push on worklist

So how to factor this?
- Specific live range + register + location selection is clearly
  higher level (and prior to) than mechanics of processing the value
  references
- Insertion of loads and stores is a mechanism from the perspective of
  the algorithm, which can supply different policies (e.g. group by
  basic block)
- Creating a new live range with our current value ref is also a
  separate step (can also be a separate step).


*** DONE Mark ARGLIST references

In determine_live_ranges, we need to handle ARGLIST specially, since
those references haven't been handled yet by the tiling process. It's
a relatively straightforward step.

We need this not because we need to be able to assign registers to
those refs, but because otherwise the register allocator is allowed to
expire values when they're still needed by ARGLIST.

*** DONE Special-case ARGLIST references

A reference to ARGLIST cannot be loaded by the general spilling
mechanism, because ARGLIST may refer to more values than can be loaded
into registers. So ARGLIST compilation should be able to deal with
'spilled' values.

Similarily, register assignment to ARGLIST tiles will not Just Work.

*** DONE Convert ARGLIST spec to ABI list

The basic idea is to have a function that is called as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
typedef struct {
    MVMJitStorageClass _cls;
    MVMint32           _pos;
} MVMJitStorageRef; /* I'll never run out of names for a cons */

MVMJitStorageRef storage_refs[16];
MVMint32 num_args = tree->nodes[tile->node + 1];, i;
MVM_jit_arch_get_arglist_storage_refs(tc, tile, tree, storage_refs);
for (i = 0; i < num_args; i++) {
   /* .... */
}
#+END_SRC

I assume that's going to be specific to the architecture (POSIX/WIN32)

*** DONE Create a queue for special tiles

Can be constructed at live-range determination time (since at that
point we iterate over all live ranges). Needs to be iterated together
with the general worklist, so that we either handle a special tile or
a live range. E.g:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  /* NB: the reason this code does not work as written is that it
     compares the tile index to the live range index, and those are not
     comparable in that way or even guaranteed to follow the same order  */
  while (alc->worklist_num) {
      if (alc->special_queue_idx < alc->special_queue_num &&
          alc->special_queue[alc->special_queue_idx] < alc->worklist[0]) {
          MVMint32 special_tile_idx = alc->special_queue[alc->special_queue_idx++];
          /* handle special tile */
      } else {
          MVMint32 v = live_range_heap_pop(tc, alc->values, alc->worklist, &alc->worklist_num);
          /* handle regular live range */
      }
  }
  while(alc->special_queue_idx < alc->special_queue_num) {
      MVMint32 special_tile_idx = alc->special_queue[alc->special_queue_idx++];
  }
#+END_SRC

*ALTERNATIVELY*: Maintain an index `last_tile_idx'.  Prior to
allocating for a live range, iterate over all tiles. between the
'last_tile_idx' and the start of the next live range.

The thing I like about this alternative is that this reduces the place
where we have to take 'magic' into account into this single loop
(rather than two), and it could also be made to deal with annoying
restrictions (including, potentially, source-is-destination-operand,
which is now handled later).

However, there is (in both cases, in fact) a trick to it; we use the
'order number' to order live ranges, but a tile index for indicating
over special tiles, and we must compare them 'correctly'. The order number is:

+ 2 * tile index for regular tiles
+ 2 * tile index - 1 for 'prior' synthetic tiles
+ 2 * tile index + 1 for 'posterior' synthetic tiles

Special tiles are always 'regular' tiles, hence their order_nr is
always 2*tile index. So we could compare the order_nr with
2*tile_idx. However I prefer to compare tile_idx with order_nr / 2;
and, to properly deal with special use requirements as well as special
compiled tiles, we include the tile of the start of the list in that.

*** DONE Support query for live-range-in-register

Specifically needed to support ejecting a live range from a register.
Can be done by building a map; can also be done by looping through the
active set. Depends a bit on the actual frequency of this happening.

*** DONE Use list of storage references to compile code for ARGLIST

- Requires the ability to eject values from their registers
  - and as such a map of register -> live range
- should sort the eviction / swapping to place values in their
  registers first
  - this may be a rather complicated bit
- requires splitting the 'spill_register' code from spilling live
  ranges code


So... we have a list of values and a list of places they need to be
in. How to put them in their right places?

+ All values that expire prior to ARGLIST start should be expired
+ All values that survive ARGLIST should be spilled to memory
  (CALL will erase them anyway)
+ A _value_ can be either in a register, or spilled to memory.
+ An _argument_ can be in a register, or on the stack.
+ Any value that is currently spilled
  + And that should be moved to a register, can be moved after swaps
  + And that should be moved to a stack location, ban de done after register loading
+ Any value that is currently active (in a register)
  + If it should be moved to stack, that should be done prior to other things
  + If it should be moved to another register, then
    + That register can either be inhabited by another argument, in
      which case the move toward it should be after this argument has 'settled'
    + Or it is inhabited by another value, in which case the move can
      be after this value has been spilled
    + Or it is not inhabited at all, in which case it can be executed
      immediately
  + We can have cycles in the 'move chain' of values, e.g. a -> b ->
    a, c -> d -> e -> c,
    + Cycles should be broken by moving a single value 'out of the
      way', e.g. by spilling to a stack location
  + No two values can 'point' to the same argument register, but a
    value could potentially point to two other registers (e.g. due
    to common subexpression elimination, or just using the same
    argument twice)

This seems to me like we should use a form of topological sort with a
cycle breaking step; in which all values 'depend' on the value that is
currently inhabiting their destination.

Implementing topological sort in this way is a manner of a FIFO queue
and a reverse dependency map. (Good bit; there can be only on
'dependent' value / register per value, even as it may itself depend
on multiple others before it can be ejected).

We can insert the refs to 'just before the CALL', i.e. insert_pos =
arglist_tile_idx + 1, insert_order = 2..(n+2)

It is probably a good idea to consume both CALL and ARGLIST at the
same time, and die if they do not follow each other.

We need to do two more things:
+ spill live ranges that will survive this call
  + annyoing bit; we have `spill_live_range` already;
  + we could have 'active_set_spill` (but why)
+ resolve conflicts between any CALL and ARGLIST nodes
  + use a bitmap to find conflicts and move values to a free registers:
  + conflict = arg_bitmap & call_bitmap
  + free_reg = ~(arg_bitmap | call_bitmap | NVR_GPR_BITMAP)
+ reserve registers used in the call node

*** DONE Implement code emitter primitives

+ insert_register_move
+ insert_copy_to_stack
+ insert_memory_to_stack_copy
+ insert_register_load - we have that one, actually

These ought to be order-sensitive, e.g. the stack stores go before the
register moves which go before the memory-to-stack-copy, and CALL args
shuffling comes before that.

I've done it using macro's since these reuse most of the 'state' of
the function.

*** DONE CALL args may already be spilleed

+ CALL nodes may take some values
+ Those values may be spilled
+ If they're spilled, a LOAD will be inserted prior to their use
+ If that load would be inserted between the ARGLIST and the CALL
+ However, the maximum 'offset' would be +1; therefore, any operations
  I'd insert with a higher offset would be after those

*** DONE Implement scratch register selection

By virtue of arg/call value resolution, we have a bitmap of values and
their respective locations; and a bitmap of 'unallocatable' registers
(well, actually... we could have a bitmap of allocatable registers).

*** DONE Spill live values over the CALL function

- things that are live only for the ARGLIST are expired in or after
  the generation of ARGLIST code, so everything that's still in the
  active set ought to be spilled.
- Stuff that is spilled should not be made 'used' in the register map,
  because we are never able to move them
  - If something is spilled, and used in the ARGLIST, then that is
    strictly speaking wasteful, but not necessarily incorrect, because
    the live range is replaced by a 'spilled' live range.
- OR the spillage is dealt with in a separate step
  - Arguably, if the spillage is limited, we can also use a 'recovery'
    step POST-call to restore arguments to what they were prior to the
    CALL.

So, I've decided to use separate spilling (and probably restorative
loading loading), so that the spillage step is taken into account for
the topological sort.

*** DONE Clean register usage of variables not used in ARGLIST

Something is either used in ARGLIST, CALL, or later;
if CALL conflicts with ARGLIST, a move is added as edge and enqueued
if used later, it's spilled and restored, if possible an inbound move is enqueued
if last used before ARGLIST, it's disregarded
if not conflicting, can't delay ARGLIST moves

*** DONE Split ARGLIST and CALL

Apparently I had rolled ARGLIST into CALL in an earlier phase....
This has a number of advantages:

- There is no way for another tile to be inserted between CALL and
  ARGLIST; arglist is tighly bound to the call.
- There is no need for an arglist-specific symbol in the tiler

However, splitting them also has the advantage:
- I can treat refs by the ARGLIST and refs to the CALL differently.

This is pretty important, because:
- There can be more ARGLIST refs than free registers. In the spilling
  process, we cannot afford to insert loads prior to ARGLIST.
- We need to find the used by ARGLIST during live-range-determination, but we don't
- CALL refs are used for calling the function (e.g. in a dispatch
  table), if such refs are spilled, they need to be loaded in the
  regular way.

*** TODO Use function return argument

We should probably allocate the return argument to a 'allocatable'
register, since the current register is not. (In fact, we should
somehow deal with specific register arguments anyway).

** DONE Split void from non-void nodes

Already did this for IF/EITHER, now for DO / DOV,
CALL/CALLV. Otherwise the tiler always selects the value-generating
one. Might also be nice for numeric/non-numeric variants.

** TODO Solve 'garbage restore' problem

The problem:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(if (test ...) (load ...) (call ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Tile list:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
0:   TEST ...
1:   JZ ->4;
2:   LOAD ...
3:   GOTO ->6;
4:   ARGLIST ...
5:   CALL ....
6: ....
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which will generate a live range that starts from (2) and presumably
survives after 6.

Hence, according to linear scan, the value of LOAD (possibliy in
register %rcx) is live on the CALL tile (5), which means that according
to it's own logic, it must spill-and-restore register %rcx arround 5, i.e.:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

5a: STORE %rcx, ...
5:  CALL ...
5b: LOAD %rcx, ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we don't take care, it will overwrite the result value of the CALL,
which must also be placed in %rcx eventually. This sucks because %rcx
is only defined in

The article 'linear scan allocation on SSA form' had a section about
this very problem, and their algorithm revolves arround finding
'lifetime holes', by scanning backwards through all basic basic blocks
and, for every definition, if that value is not the first definition,
inserting a hole.

In our case we might be able to do this relatively cheaply, because:
- it's SSA form, so a value is only defined once per basic block
- at worst, it is used prior in the basic block (e.g. in a looping
  construct, or by deriving from the alternative value, e.g.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let (($foo ..)) (if (zr $foo) $foo (load (addr $foo ...))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

NB, not a very good example because it probably does not require a
spill in the alternative block.  Anyway....

- So the scope of the hole ends at the start of the second defintion,
  and it starts:
  - either at the last use within the same basic block
  - or at the end of the last basic block in which another definition
    'dominates' (not sure if I'm using that terminology right).
- In other words, there exists some scope where the earlier definition
  is still live, and some point at which that stops, and that point is
  the hole.
  - A conservative first-best-guesss would be from the second
    definition to the last use or the begin of the basic block, which
    would already help sufficiently for the garbage-restore problem.
- It's only relevant for live ranges with multiple definitions anyway,
  so that cuts down on the number
- The maximum number of holes is the sum of definitions in that set
  minus the number of live ranges; this certainty allows us to
  preallocate a block of memory for the holes.

*** TODO Determine basic blocks

We want two facts for every basic block
- the range of instructions (tiles) covered (from- and to- inclusive)
- the basic blocks preceeding or following this block, or both

The basic block structure is (fortunately) completely determined at
tile-generation time:

- We start with a single basic block starting at the beginning of the
  tree
- WHEN (A, B, C)
  - basic block A ends after test (jump), followed by B and C
  - basic block B is the conditional block (between test jump and end
    label), followed by C and preceeded by A
  - basic block C begins after the conditional clause (label),
    preceeded by A and B
- IF/IFV (A, B, C, D)
  - A ends after test, followed by B, C
  - B starts after conditional jump and ends at unconditional jump
    (before alternative label), preceeded by A,
  - C starts before alternative label (after unconditional jump),
- ALL/ANY (A, B1 .. Bn, C)
  - A ends after first test
  - B1 starts after test, until next (conditional jump)
    - All B blocks are preceeded either by A or another B block,
  - C is preceeded by all of A, B1-Bn
- Therefore, we start with 1 basic block; every WHEN adds 2 basic
  blocks, every IF/IFV adds 3 basic blocks; a hypothetical LOOP
  construct would also add 2 basic blocks, every ALL/ANY adds n basic
  blocks.
- Any basic block has at most 2 following basic blocks (demarcated by
  either a jump, conditional jump, or a label)
  - Note that `jumplist` is an exception like ARGLIST is an exception,
    and we can deal with those separately

*** TODO Determine live range holes
*** TODO Don't spill 'holes' in ARGLIST
*** TODO Try to use 'holes' in allocation.

** TODO Implement optimistic 'store' insertion

Currently our inserting of stores is pessimistic, i.e. stores are
always inserted where they would be expected from the MoarVM bytecode.
But this is not necessary if the stored value is overwritten within
the same basic block. We can work on eliminating that, but I had
assumed that it'd be easy to get the last-use-per-value via spesh, and
it isn't. What we can do is:

- maintain a table of the last-definition per MoarVM register (hey, we
  do that now)
- insert stores where necessary, which is:
  - find all nodes that have recent definitions
    - insert a 'store-to-moar-register' instruction (MVM_jit_expr_add_store)
    - swap the 'root' pointing to the definition node with the store
      node (this may require a scan through the table)
- figure out when it is necessary
  - before throwing (or 'throwish)
  - before jumping to another basic block
  - ....
- store the spesh instruction tagged to the tree, so that we can find
  out where it should be stored if it isn't

** TODO Apply register requirements

Bunch of options possible:
- it's a requirement for an output register
  - the register is allocatable
    - which is /free/, in which case we can just take it (how I do I
      know it's free? by a register map, which we need to make)
    - which is /not free/, in which case we need to /spill/ the
      current register
  - the register is not allocatable (e.g. %rax)
    - I'm going to go ahead and assume that it is free nevertheless,
      otherwise we'd have to record the set of non-allocatable
      registers clobbered
    - However, if the value is to live, it's probably best to copy it
      to an allocatable register
- it is a requirement for an input register
  - that is not yet a problem I have (because I made %rax the spare
    register), but most of the considerations of clobbering described
    below apply
  - it is an existing problem for ARGLIST compilation, but there it is
    handled seprately (although it is fairly similar, and might generalize!)
- it clobbers a register (not necessarily one it uses), e.g. div which
  clobbers %rdx to store the modulo (and %rax for the quotient).
  - if free, no problem whatever
  - if non-free, we again need to start moving registers, but I'm not
    sure this requires the full shuffling requirements of ARGLIST.


* TODO Optimizer

Idea is to have a tree-walking step between tree generation and
tiling, that can optimize tree expressions.

- common subexpression elimination
  - idea: (hash) table of expr, node
  - table is created bottom-up
    - all children are replaced with equivalent (according to the table)
    - then parent is itself 'hashed' to a record, an potentially
      replaced
- IDX CONST to ADDR conversion
  - Uses one register less, simpler operation
- ADD CONST to ADDR conversion
  - only allowed if user is pointerlike (e.g. LOAD)
- COPY insertion
  - Values that are LOAD-ed and used from multiple operations might
    benefit from inserting a COPY, so they don't use indirect
    operations, e.g.
  - Basic idea: count number of users of 'load', if > 1, insert the
    COPY node and replace the refs
  - Possibly a pessimization because it requires more registers!

#+BEGIN_SRC asm

* TODO REPR Specialization

- Want to add a "JIT" method to on REPR add expression fragments into
  the tree for specific REPRs of objects
- One of the requirements is to be able to specify expression
  fragments for specific REPRs, e.g. via repr-specific expression
  template files.
- We *especially* want this for nativecall, so it might be worthwhile
  to look into that first.

* General cleanups
** TODO Reduce tree node size to 32 bits

 Tree nodes are currently 64 bits wide to allow them to coexist with
 constant pointers. This is handy, but not really required, since we
 could use a lookup table to get the pointers (as long as we can
 declare pointers, for which I think we can still use the '@' sigil, e.g:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (template: say
    (call (const @MVM_string_say ptr_sz)
          (arglist 2
            (carg (tc) ptr)
            (carg $0 ptr))
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 The @MVM_string_say pointer can be stashed in an array:

 #+BEGIN_SRC C
 static const void *MVM_jit_expr_ptrs[] = {
    ...
    MVM_string_say,
    ...
 };
 #+END_SRC

 And the pointer itself replaced by the index.

 We could argue against dealing with 64 bit constants in general, but
 unfortunately, const_i64 prevents us from doing that.... Ways of
 dealing with that:

 + A 'large constants' table per tree (into which we could copy both the
   i64 constants and the function pointer constants)
   + We could store this entire table in the data section, too
 + A 'large constants' op, which could take the space to store the 64
   bit constant directly; one of the advantages of that is that we
   could specialise tiling to that (e.g. there is no advantage to
   including a very large constant in the ADD tile since the underlying
   'add' instruction cannot handle it).
 + Or both: have a large_const op and a large_const table, and only
   have the large_const op refer to the large_const table (i.e. not the
   regular const)

** TODO Improve logging

 Currently logging is *extremely* adhoc and pretty much only
 human-parseable. There are a bunch of things I want to improve about
 that.

*** TODO Profilers should know why stuff didn't get compiled

 When something is not compiled, that's usually because there is
 something in it the compiler can't handle. I think we should be able
 to stash that reason in a profiler context object, serialize and
 display it somehow.

*** DONE Digraph expression logging can take parameters in node

 Currently, constant parameters are displayed as separate nodes, and
 stuff would be cleaner if we didn't do that, e.g. rather let ADDR
 point to some constant number, write ADDR($constant).

** DONE Templare value ordering

 The problem:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (if (test $bar) $quix (derive $quix))
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 In this case, $quix is refered to in both conditional branches, but
 might not be computed before the consequent of the `IF`. The tiler
 will *not* insert the computation for $quix twice, meaning that in the
 alternative block, $quix is not computed but used. This is an error.

 The current solution is to use a 'let' declaration, which predeclares
 the variable and ensures that it is compiled prior to the let block, e.g:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (let (($quam (copy $quix))) (if (test $bar) $quam (derive $quam)))
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 But that sucks, because a): it inserts a redundant copy, b): it relies
 on the user doing the right thing (which is possible to detect
 statically, for templates, though, but perhaps not so easy for
 'dynamically' generated tree nodes), c): it relies on a hacky
 'rooting' mechanism in the tree template building and application
 step.

 So the idea is to:
 - detect if the first reference to a node is conditional
 - and if there are other references that lie outside that conditional
 - and if that is true, insert a root prior to the start of the
   conditional

 This makes me think of using a conditional-branch stack.  Let's
 record, on first visitation, the top-of-the conditional branch stack.
 If a second visit does not lead to the same top, it should be
 unconditionalized (by adding a root).
 - We could add an explicit stack, anyway.
   - A stack item consist of the node and the child number.
 - And if we have that, there's no reason to do implicit recursion
   anymore.
 - And if we have that, we only need to add a counter (we don't really
   need that, but it makes stuff cheaper)

*** Automatic unconditionalizing

 This is documented for future reference, but not the plan I actually
 intend to take, due to the associated complexity.

**** TODO Switch tree walking to use an explicit stack

  Simple, mechanical transformation. I wonder if we can have a maximum
  depth; probably not, if we can allow revisits.

**** TODO Find greatest unconditional defined block
**** TODO Detect references beyond unconditional defined block
**** TODO Detect if a reference is safely movable

  - not all references are safey moveable, e.g. a load that is 'guarded'
    by a check in ALL is not.

**** TODO Order the reference computation to an inclusive scope 

  It is probably not necessary to do repeat visits - in fact let's not!
  But we can do a postorder analysis to see if any of the children is
  defined first in a conditional block, and if that conditional block is
  the same as what we're in. (Can that actually happen? probably, yes,
  in a DO thing).

  That said; if we're going to move references, we don't actually need
  to insert a new root; we can replace the existing root with a DO or
  DOV that contains the declaration first and the use second. (This
  requires detecting if the expression results a REG or VOID).

*** DONE Local ordering of LET

 Currently the 'let' statement has an ordering purpose aside from it's
 declaration. The weakness of this is that it uses the 'rooting'
 mechanism which applies a *global* ordering to the *template* level,
 i.e., /any/ LET declaration is applied prior to *any* expression
 compilation. So, for instance, the following will not do what you
 want:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (let (($foo (load ....)))
   (if (nz $foo)
       (let (($bar (load $foo ...)))
            (add $foo $bar))
       (const 0)))
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Because it will compile as:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 0:  $foo = LOAD ...
 1:  $bar = LOAD $foo ...
 2:  TEST $foo
 3:  IFZR GOTO 6
 4:  $out = ADD $foo $bar
 5:  GOTO 7
 6:  $out = CONST 0
 7:  ...
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 However, what we want is equivalent to:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (do
    (declare $foo (load ...))
    (if (nz $foo)
       (do
         (declare $bar (load $foo ...))
         (add $foo $bar))
       (const 0)))
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Which, owing to the 'natural' ordering effect of DO, will compile as:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 0: $foo = LOAD ...
 1: TEST $foo
 2: IFZR GOTO 6
 3: $bar = LOAD $foo ...
 4: $out = ADD $foo $bar
 5: GOTO 7
 6: $out = CONTST 0
 7: ...
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 However, this is essentially a template-compile time step, to
 translate the LET statements into DO (or DOV) statements.
