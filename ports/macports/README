When updating the Portfile to reflect the new release:

1) update the version
2) remove the revision, if any is currently specified.
3) Recalculate the checksums (commands given in the file for this.) Keep the trailing \ on the first line.
4) Create a unified diff from 
   https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/MoarVM/Portfile?format=txt
   to our most recent copy.
5) create an "update" ticket in http://trac.macports.org/ - you'll need a trac account to open the ticket. Be sure to attach the diff, and list "MoarVM" as the port.
