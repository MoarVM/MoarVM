When updating the Portfile to reflect the new release:

First, update the portfile

1) update the version
2) remove the revision, if any is currently specified.
3) Recalculate the checksums (commands given in the file for this.) Keep the trailing \ on the first line.

Then, test out the portfile locally.

4) Setup a local portfile directory. Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf, adding a reference to a local directory, like: file:///Users/bob/sandbox/macports/ 
5) In that folder, create a subdir lang/MoarVM
6) copy the updated Portfile to that folder.
7) Reindex to pick up the new portfile: `portindex`
8) From the top level of that folder, verify that we still build with our declared dependencies with, e.g. `port -t build MoarVM@2015.04`
9) Install the port, e.g. `sudo port install MoarVM@2015.04`

Finally, open a ticket to update the portfile

10) Create a unified diff from 
   https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/MoarVM/Portfile?format=txt
   to our most recent copy.
11) create an "update" ticket in http://trac.macports.org/ - you'll need a trac account to open the ticket. Be sure to attach the diff, and list "MoarVM" as the port. Additionally, set keywords to "haspatch", and if you're listed as a maintainer, "maintainer"
12) git push the updated Portfile
13) hang out in #macports on freenode and mention the ticket.
