# adding `shallow = true` to each submodule would save about 12M on a
# git clone --recursive
#
# however, adding it tickles a bug in git not fixed until 2.32.0, in that with
# `shallow = true` here, `git submodule --quiet update` *isn't* "--quiet". If
# `shallow = true` is found here, then the `--quiet` flag is not passed down
# from `git submodule` to `git fetch` because `git submodule` takes a different
# code path from the default case. *Even though* the submodule fetch it invokes
# isn't shallow!
