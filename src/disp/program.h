/* A dispatch program is set of operations that we execute in order to perform
 * a dispatch. A dispatch callsite goes through a number of states:
 *
 * 1. Unlinked. This means that we will unconditionally run the dispatch
 *    callback. This can set guards, do capture transformations, delegate,
 *    and eventually ends up at a dispatch terminal. This set of steps make
 *    up the dispatch program; we say that the dispatch callback "records" a
 *    dispatch program.
 * 2. Monomorphic. This means that we have a single dispatch program recorded
 *    and we try to play it back. The dispatch program is a series of linear
 *    steps.
 * 3. Polymorphic. This means that we have recorded multiple dispatch programs
 *    at this callsite. We store each program, but may also store a tree or
 *    other prefix-lifting form of the programs. (However, the first cut will
 *    probably just run them in order.)
 * 4. Megamorphic. This means that we have reached the maximum number of
 *    dispatch programs we're willing to record here. Now we either call a
 *    megamorphic handler callback if one is registered, or otherwise run
 *    the dispatch program but without building up any guards.
 *
 * These states are modelled as different callbacks in the inline cache at the
 * callsite.
