/* A worklist holds the current set of pointers we have got in the queue
 * to scan. We hide away the details of it behind this abstraction since
 * the order in which we hand things back from it can have a big influence
 * on locality in the copied/compacted heap, and thus mutator performance.
 *
 * For the time being, we do the simplest possible thing: just make it a
 * stack. This actually has reasonable properties if we scan objects right
 * after they are copied/moved, since an object's children will then come
 * right after the object itself - unless they were copied/moved earlier.
 * But things aren't quite so rosy for deeply nested data structures, where
 * two siblings may thus end up far apart. Lots of stuff in the literature
 * on these issues, but for now this is probably less bad than some of the
 * other options.
