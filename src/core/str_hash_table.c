 * As originally implemented one beyond the end of the metadata there was a
 * sentinel byte with the value 1. It transpires that 0 will work just as well.
 *
 * To simplify the search code in `fetch` and `delete` there needs to be a value
 * there *that can be read* that represents "not found" (so either an empty slot
 * or an entry with a lower probe distance). 0 is an empty slot, 1 is an entry
 * in its ideal slot - either will do. (Don't worry about metadata shifting -
 * the comment that this commit deletes explains how that used to be handled).
 *
 * By having this sentinel `fetch` and `delete` can eliminate an extra condition
 * check in the loop - they no longer need to also test for "have we exceeded
 * the probe distance", because (instead) they will always terminate in this
 * case by finding an entry with a lower probe distance (or an empty slot). The
 * sentinel covers the corner case of maximum possible probe distance starting
 * from the last bucket.
 *
 * Martin Ankerl's implementation used a sentinel of 1, because it was also
 * needed to terminate the word-at-a-time iterator skip ahead, which rapidly
 * traverses the metadata corresponding to large unallocated areas. We don't
 * need that, and won't need that at the *end* even if we do choose to implement
 * word-at-a-time iterators, because we iterate in reverse, from the end of the
 * metadata to the start. (If we need a sentinel at all, it would need to be the
 * last byte of the control structure. And could "cheat" and share space with
 * anything in the control structure that is guaranteed to be non-zero,)
 *
 * To avoid too much early metadata shifting, we don't start with 6 bits of
 * hash. Max is currently 5 bits (we should check if 4 is better). Which means
 * we can never grow the probe distance on our smallest 8 + 5 allocation - we
 * always hit the probe distance limit first and resize to a 16 + 11 hash.

                     * (another size optimisation) hence *it* can't store zero.

                     * true state. See commit 7d6107e65ddedece
                     *
                     * The assumption of that commit was that it was impossible
                     * for the control structure to be in that (zero,zero) state
                     * as soon as any insert happened, because after that
                     * max_items would only be set to zero if an insert flagged
                     * up that the `max_probe_distance` might overflow on the
                     * *next* insert (ie trigger that immediate allocation),
                     * and if there are items allocated, then (obviously)
                     * `cur_items` isn't zero.
                     *
                     * What I missed was that a sequence of inserts followed by
                     * a sequence of deletes can reach (zero,zero).
                     * If the *last* insert hits the `max_probe_distance` limit,
                     * then it sets `max_items` to zero so that the next insert
                     * will allocate.
                     *
                     * But what if there is no next insert?
                     *
                     * Then nothing resets the `max_items`, and it remains as
                     * zero.
                     *
                     * And if the only write actions that happen on the hash
                     * after this are to delete each entry in turn, then
                     * eventually `cur_items` reaches zero too (accurately), and
                     * then the "special state" flags are accidentally recreated
                     * but not with the "special state" memory layout.
                     *
                     * (And with enough debugging enabled the assignment to
                     *  `control->last_delete_at` just below fails an assertion
                     *  in `MVM_str_hash_metadata`)

                     * probe distance below the limit because (this one is
                     * subtle) worst case it's possible for
                     * a) a hash to be in the state where several entries have
                     *    probe distances one below the threshold
                     * b) a *single* insert causes 2+ of these to move up
                     *    (the "make room" code in insert)
                     *    (or 1 to move up, *and* the new insert to be at the
                     *     the trigger distance)
                     *    which sets the flag
                     * c) but the immediately subsequent deletion causes only
                     *    *one* of these to drop back below the max.
                     *
                     * The really conservative approach would only be to reset
